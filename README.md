Hey, I'm iKarTehFox ðŸ‘‹

I work with js, ts, html, and css, all the good web stuff.  
JavaScript is the best programming language. fight me.

### My projects
- [web-clock](https://github.com/iKarTehFox/web-clock) is my favorite thing Iâ€™ve made. 2 years and counting.
- [qrank](https://github.com/iKarTehFox/qrank) is a qr code generator for jokes and pranks I guess
- [color-toy](https://github.com/iKarTehFox/color-toy) is a tool which lets you view a single color in fullscreen.
- I listen to music a lot. sometimes I sing along (badly)
- take the occasional photo here and there too
