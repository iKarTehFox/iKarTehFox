Hiya, I'm iKarTehFox... or iKTF... or Karaoke, whatever you remember me as. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A couple of the projects I am proud of on here are:
- [Online Web Clock](https://github.com/iKarTehFox/web-clock) - My own little online clock app thing, which has been in development for a little over two years now
- [Color Toy](https://github.com/iKarTehFox/color-toy) - A website which lets you test out text/background color contrast, or just display a solid color fullscreen
- [QRank](https://github.com/iKarTehFox/qrank) - A custom QR code generator which sends curious people to a site with your custom message (like.. for "pranks" ig)

Thanks for taking interest into my GitHub profile. I'd you'd like to talk, you know where to find my portfolio. I need friends :(
